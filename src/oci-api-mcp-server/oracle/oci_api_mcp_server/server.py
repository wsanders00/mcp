    """Returns helpful instructions for running an OCI CLI command.

    IMPORTANT:
      - Only provide the command _after_ 'oci' — do not include the string
        'oci' in `command`.
      - Never use the information returned by this tool to instruct an end
        user directly. Use it only to determine which command to run
        yourself using run_oci_command.

    Command structure guidance:
      - OCI subcommands are organized as:
            <service> <subcommand> <subcommand> ...
        e.g.
        compute instance list OR
        compute instance action-name OR
        recovery protected-database-collection list-protected-databases
      - Services vary in how they structure their CLI. Some use
        explicit resource tokens (compute instance list), others use
        collection names or hyphenated actions
        (e.g. list-protected-databases),
        and some have deeper subcommand chains (service sub1 sub2 sub3 ...).

    How to ask for help:
      - Start with the most specific form you think is correct, for example:
          compute instance list
          compute instance action-name
          recovery protected-database-collection list-protected-databases
      - If the specific request returns an error, progressively make it
        less specific:
          1. try the full command (most specific)
          2. remove the final token and try again
          3. repeat until you reach just the service name (e.g. compute)
      - Additionally, if a service commonly uses hyphenated commands for
        list operations, try hyphenated forms as well
        e.g.
          recovery protected-database-collection list-protected-databases OR
          psql db-system-collection list-db-systems.
