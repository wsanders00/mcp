## Configuration

The server supports multiple OCI SDK authentication modes through `OCI_MCP_AUTH_TYPE`.
The older `OCI_IOT_AUTH_TYPE` remains supported as a deprecated alias; the canonical
variable takes precedence when both are set.

Supported values:

- `auto`
- `security_token`
- `api_key`
- `instance_principal`
- `resource_principal`
- `instance_principal_delegation`
- `resource_principal_delegation`
- `oke_workload_identity`

If neither variable is set, the server defaults to `auto`.

`auto` uses the selected OCI configuration profile and behaves as follows:

1. If the selected profile directly declares `security_token_file`, the server selects session-token auth. A value inherited only from `[DEFAULT]` does not select session-token auth; `auto` uses API-key auth instead.
2. If no token file is declared directly, `auto` uses standard API-key auth from the selected profile.

When `security_token` is selected explicitly, the selected profile must directly declare
`security_token_file`; a value inherited from `[DEFAULT]` is rejected. A declared session
token that is missing, empty, or otherwise invalid fails closed instead of falling back to
API-key auth. Token-file contents are trimmed before signer construction.

`OCI_CONFIG_FILE` selects the OCI configuration file and `OCI_CONFIG_PROFILE` selects
the profile. If the profile is not set, it defaults to `DEFAULT`.
`OCI_REGION` overrides the configured profile or principal region.
The older `ORACLE_MCP_AUTH_PROFILE` profile selector remains supported temporarily.

`instance_principal` is intended for code running on OCI compute instances with instance principal access.

`resource_principal` is intended for OCI runtime environments that expose resource principal credentials.

`instance_principal_delegation` and `resource_principal_delegation` accept
`OCI_MCP_DELEGATION_TOKEN_FILE`. Inline `OCI_MCP_DELEGATION_TOKEN` and the legacy
`OCI_IOT_DELEGATION_TOKEN` remain supported temporarily with a deprecation warning.
Do not set both the canonical token file and an inline token; the combination is rejected.

`oke_workload_identity` is intended for OKE workload identity environments. You can optionally override the
service account token source with either:

- `OCI_MCP_OKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_PATH`
- `OCI_MCP_OKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` (deprecated inline form)

The legacy `OCI_IOT_OKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_PATH` and
`OCI_IOT_OKE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` variables remain supported temporarily. Set only
one token source; configuring both a path and an inline token is rejected. Earlier
versions gave the inline OKE token precedence when both were set.

Identity-scoped paths that need an explicit tenancy OCID, such as `list_compartments`, may also require:

- `OCI_MCP_TENANCY_ID_OVERRIDE`

The legacy `OCI_IOT_TENANCY_ID_OVERRIDE` remains supported temporarily.

`auto` still only covers profile-backed security-token and API-key flows. It does not auto-detect
delegation-token or OKE workload-identity auth.

For the direct OCI IoT Data API tools, you can also provide a bearer token through the
`OCI_IOT_DATA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

For ORDS-backed operator tools, set:

- `OCI_IOT_ORDS_CLIENT_ID`
- `OCI_IOT_ORDS_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OCI_IOT_ORDS_USERNAME`
- `OCI_IOT_ORDS_PASSWORD`

## Usage Notes

- `get_digital_twin_instance_content` supports `should_include_metadata=true` to include digital twin
  instance metadata in the response payload.
- Digital twin instance tools expose gateway-aware OCI IoT fields. `connectivity_type` may be `DIRECT`,
  `INDIRECT`, `GATEWAY`, or `NONE`; indirect twins can include `gateways` with gateway digital twin
  instance OCIDs.
- `list_digital_twin_instances` supports SDK filters such as `connectivity_type`, model identifiers,
  display name, lifecycle state, sort fields, page token, `id`, and `opc_request_id` while preserving
  the existing list return shape.
- `list_digital_twin_relationships` supports SDK filters such as display name, content path, source/target
  twin OCIDs, lifecycle state, sort fields, page token, `id`, and `opc_request_id` while preserving the
  existing list return shape.
- Use `list_digital_twin_relationships_page` when an agent needs `opc_next_page` and request metadata for
  a single SDK page. Use `list_all_digital_twin_relationships` for bounded verifier workflows that need
  to count relationships across pages without dumping an unbounded domain.
- Use `get_digital_twin_instance_full` when inspecting newly released SDK fields before the typed MCP
  response model is updated.
- List-style SDK tools return a structured payload with a `result` field containing the list of items.
- Custom operator tools return stable `{ "ok": true, "data": ... }` or `{ "ok": false, "error": ... }`
  envelopes.
- String-returning tools such as `get_digital_twin_instance_content` and `get_digital_twin_model_spec`
  return plain text content.

## IoT Resource Lifecycle Guidance

### Domain group types

See Oracle's [domain group guidance](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/internet-of-things/create-domain-group.htm).

New IoT domain groups use `PRODUCTION` or `DEVELOPMENT`. If `type` is omitted,
OCI selects `DEVELOPMENT`, which uses fewer resources for development and
testing. `PRODUCTION` supports scaling and high availability with automatic
failover. A group's type is immutable; create a new group to use a different
type. Existing `STANDARD` and `LIGHTWEIGHT` groups remain available until
2027-04-14. The create and list tools pass supplied type values to OCI without
normalizing them.

### Deleting an IoT domain

See the [OCI IoT release note](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/releasenotes/internet-of-things/update-06092026.htm).

OCI rejects deletion of an IoT domain while active digital twin resources
remain. Delete the associated digital twin instances before calling
`delete_iot_domain`. The service enforces this restriction.

### Upgrading a digital twin model

See Oracle's [compatible model version upgrade scenario](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/internet-of-things/create-new-model-version.htm).

For an additive model change, create the exact next minor version (`+.1`) in the
same model family and major version, keeping existing model elements and their
contracts unchanged. Then create a new adapter for that model version and
update the existing digital twin instance to use the new adapter. This keeps
the twin's identity. OCI checks model and adapter compatibility; this server
does not validate DTDL compatibility locally or migrate twins automatically.

Major-version changes and changes that break existing model elements are not
compatible with this upgrade path; use a new model and digital twin instance
for those changes. Model downgrades are unsupported. Keep prior models and
adapters available for twins that still use them and for recovery planning, but
do not assume an upgraded twin can switch to an adapter for an older model.

## Agent Workflow Guidance

- `get_twin_platform_context` is the best first call when an agent needs to understand how a twin maps to
  its domain, domain group, adapter, model, gateway topology, and ORDS/Data API context.
- `get_latest_twin_state` is the best current-state call when an agent needs the newest observed
  snapshot, historized, raw-command, and rejected-data records without manually querying each collection.
- `validate_twin_readiness` is the passive health check when an agent needs to confirm selector
  resolution, domain context, ORDS credential presence, token minting, and whether snapshot data is
  actually arriving.
- These tools intentionally return structured teaching payloads rather than raw ORDS collection pages so
  an agent can reason about topology and state with fewer follow-up calls.

## Gateway-Aware Twin Instances

Create a gateway twin:

```json
{
  "tool": "create_digital_twin_instance",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "display_name": "factory-gateway-01",
    "connectivity_type": "GATEWAY"
  }
}
```

Create an indirect twin through a gateway:

```json
{
  "tool": "create_digital_twin_instance",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "display_name": "pump-17",
    "connectivity_type": "INDIRECT",
    "gateways": [
      "ocid1.iotdigitaltwininstance.oc1..gatewayexample"
    ]
  }
}
```

Update an indirect twin's gateway references:

```json
{
  "tool": "update_digital_twin_instance",
  "arguments": {
    "digital_twin_instance_id": "ocid1.iotdigitaltwininstance.oc1..example",
    "gateways": [
      "ocid1.iotdigitaltwininstance.oc1..gatewayexample"
    ]
  }
}
```

List indirect twins:

```json
{
  "tool": "list_digital_twin_instances",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "connectivity_type": "INDIRECT",
    "limit": 100
  }
}
```

List one page of relationships with pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "tool": "list_digital_twin_relationships_page",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "limit": 100,
    "lifecycle_state": "ACTIVE"
  }
}
```

Count relationship topology across bounded pages:

```json
{
  "tool": "list_all_digital_twin_relationships",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "max_items": 500,
    "page_size": 100,
    "lifecycle_state": "ACTIVE"
  }
}
```

## Friendly Identifier Rules

- `digital_twin_instance_id` and `iot_domain_id` work directly.
- Domain display-name lookup and `domain_short_id` lookup require `compartment_id` so the server
  can scope the control-plane search before returning a short identifier.
- Twin display-name lookup requires the IoT domain selector to resolve first; the twin lookup never
  runs without an identified domain context.
- Ambiguous friendly matches fail with `ambiguous_identifier` and list candidate identifiers so
  the caller can prompt for a retry with a specific choice.
- Short IDs are derived from the control-plane resources instead of being memorized; helpers such as
  `get_data_api_token` and `derive_domain_context` can surface those identifiers once the related
  domain context is resolved.

## ORDS Credentials And Token Behavior

- `get_data_api_token` returns a live bearer token and expiry metadata to the MCP caller.
- Treat the returned bearer token as a secret and do not log, persist, or echo it beyond the intended
  caller.
- Minted tokens are cached process-locally by IoT domain and credential fingerprint until expiry. The
  cache is not persisted, is cleared by process restart, and tokens must never be logged.
- `get_twin_platform_context`, `get_latest_twin_state`, `validate_twin_readiness`,
  `invoke_raw_command_and_wait`, `get_raw_command_by_request_id`, `list_recent_raw_commands_for_twin`,
  `list_recent_rejected_data_for_twin`, and `wait_for_twin_update` resolve ORDS access automatically
  from the provided domain and twin selectors.
- When the ORDS credentials (`OCI_IOT_ORDS_CLIENT_ID`, `OCI_IOT_ORDS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OCI_IOT_ORDS_USERNAME`,
  and `OCI_IOT_ORDS_PASSWORD`) are configured, `get_data_api_token`, `get_latest_twin_state`, and
  `validate_twin_readiness` can mint tokens on the caller’s behalf without an explicit bearer token
  input. Callers can still supply a pre-minted token via `access_token` if they prefer to reuse it.
- `list_recent_raw_commands_for_twin` and `list_recent_rejected_data_for_twin` enforce a `limit` in the
  range `1` to `100`; values outside that range result in validation failures.
- `wait_for_twin_update` always requires the `since` argument and the value must be a valid RFC 3339
  timestamp so the helper can poll after the specified cursor.

## IoT Data API Notes

- These tools target the **OCI Internet of Things Platform Data API**, not the older Oracle Internet of
  Things Cloud Service product.
- Direct Data API tools require `iot_domain_group_short_id` and `iot_domain_short_id`.
- Direct list/get raw, snapshot, historized, rejected, and rawCommand helpers also require an
  `access_token` parameter unless the `OCI_IOT_DATA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable is set.
- The Data API also requires a bearer token. Pass it with the `access_token` parameter or set
  `OCI_IOT_DATA_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
- If `region` is omitted, the tools default to the region in the configured OCI profile.
- List-style Data API tools accept optional `query_params` as an object or JSON string and pass them
  through to the API query string.
- The Data API base URL format is:

```text
https://{iot_domain_group_short_id}.data.iot.{region}.oci.oraclecloud.com/ords/{iot_domain_short_id}
```

  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example"
  }
}
```

Explain how a configured twin is wired into OCI IoT:

{
  "tool": "get_twin_platform_context",
  "arguments": {
    "digital_twin_instance_name": "pump-17",
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example"

  "tool": "get_latest_twin_state",
  "arguments": {
    "digital_twin_instance_id": "ocid1.iotdigitaltwininstance.oc1..example"
  }
}
```

{
  "tool": "list_raw_data",
  "arguments": {
    "iot_domain_group_short_id": "exampleDomainGroupShortId",
    "iot_domain_short_id": "exampleDomainShortId",
    "query_params": {
      "limit": 50
    }
  }
}
```

Invoke a raw command and wait for the resulting data-plane record by friendly twin name:

```json
{
  "tool": "invoke_raw_command_and_wait",
  "arguments": {
    "digital_twin_instance_name": "pump-17",
    "iot_domain_id": "ocid1.iotdomain.oc1..example",
    "request_endpoint": "/commands/reboot",
